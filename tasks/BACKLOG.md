### [TASK-0037] Rigor — bootstrap re-run to fill kill-switch p5 Sharpe thresholds

- **Status:** todo
- **Priority:** low
- **Created:** 2026-04-21
- **Source:** session
- **Context:** TASK-0026 documented drawdown and duration kill-switch thresholds for SMA crossover and RSI mean-reversion, but the bootstrap p5 Sharpe threshold is PENDING for both. The CLI commands are ready; the Zerodha token needs to be refreshed to run them.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Run `go run ./cmd/backtest --strategy sma-crossover ... --bootstrap` (full command in `decisions/algorithm/2026-04-21-kill-switch-sma-crossover.md`)
  - [ ] Run `go run ./cmd/backtest --strategy rsi-mean-reversion ... --bootstrap` (full command in `decisions/algorithm/2026-04-21-kill-switch-rsi-mean-reversion.md`)
  - [ ] Paste the `Per-trade Sharpe p5` value from each run into the respective decision file, replacing `PENDING`
  - [ ] Update decision file status from `accepted` (PENDING) to reflect actual values
- **Notes:** Both strategies failed the proliferation gate — these thresholds are reference values, not live deployment approval. With only 7 and 22 trades respectively, the p5 Sharpe will have wide confidence intervals. Document that caveat alongside the values.

### [TASK-0036] Research tooling — Python notebooks layer + file contract

- **Status:** todo
- **Priority:** low
- **Created:** 2026-04-16
- **Source:** session
- **Context:** The 2D heatmap, equity curve plots, and regime visualizations have nowhere to live.
  A `notebooks/` directory with a documented file contract is the prerequisite for any
  visualization work and establishes the Go-writes/Python-reads boundary explicitly.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] `notebooks/` directory at project root, version-controlled
  - [ ] `notebooks/README.md` documents file contract: equity curve CSV schema, sweep CSV schema, analytics JSON schema, column names, timestamp format
  - [ ] `notebooks/requirements.txt` with pyarrow, pandas, matplotlib pinned
  - [ ] At least one working notebook: `notebooks/equity-curve.ipynb` reads `runs/<name>-curve.csv` and plots equity curve with regime shading
- **Notes:** Depends on TASK-0029 (equity curve CSV output) for the first working notebook.
  The file contract in README.md is the formal boundary — Python never feeds back into Go inputs.
